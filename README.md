## Setting Up Dev Environment

2. Install MongoDB
   1. [These instructions are good](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/)
3. Type  `yarn` inside the root directory  (Download Server Dependencies) 
4. Type `yarn` inside the client directory (Download Front-end Dependencies)
5. Make dev.js file inside config folder
6. Put mongoDB info into dev.js file
   1. You can probably just copy `prod.js` 

## Starting the App
